# ECS Engine
This is a simple Entity Component System (ECS), originally developed as a subsystem for a game engine project I am currently working on.

After creating a minimum working prototype, I decided to move the ECS into its own dedicated repository.

* **1:** This allows other projects of mine to easily utilize the ECS.
* **2:** It enables features to be added to the ECS in a more structured and organized manner.

All future development and feature additions for this ECS will be handled in this repository.
